## My Manifesto 

If you have spoken with me in recent months you will know that I have become somewhat of an evangalist. Only the good news I have to spread is not the gospel, but the wonders of GitHub; a hosting site that provides version control for open-source projects. 

However, the conversations I have had in months past, to my initial shock and dismay, have revealed to me that few share in my conversion. In hindsight, I should not have been so surprised. Of my friends and acquaintances most are either social scientists or engineers (I know, I need to get out more).

I have since learned that if you do not have a background in software engineering, then there is a good chance you have heard of, but have not been exposed to GitHub. Indeed, that was my case. While I had seen plenty of people reference or link to GitHub repositories (mostly on social media), I never had the opportunity or the encouragement to work on a project that used this service. In the end, it was the consistent reference to GitHub on Twitter (and a casual mention from one of my thesis supervisors) that pushed me to try the service. 

It took a day for me to realize that there was no going back to my old heathanistic lifestyle; I had finally seen the light. How could I have been so blind for so long? 

Today, I would like to convince you, dear reader, of what I have learned: that GitHub is for everyone, regardless of your ~~race, gender, and~~ occupation or interests! If you work with data then GitHub is for you! 

## What is it? 


Here are four reasons why you should use GitHub. 

## Reason 1: Version Control

## Reason 2: Science and Reproducability 

## Reason 3: Collaboration with Colleagues

## Reason 4: Community Support
