*GitHub is for everyone, not only developers. This article presents four reasons why anyone working with data stands to benefit from using GitHub.*

## GitHub is for Everyone

If you have spoken with me in recent months you will know that I have become somewhat of an evangalist. Only the good news I have to spread is not the gospel, but the wonders of GitHub.

> GitHub is a hosting site that provides version control for open-source projects, which is a fancy way of saying that GitHub is a servicee that hosts your data and keeps a record of all the changes that you make to it. 

Conversations that I have had in months past, however, revealed to me that few share in my recent conversion. In hindsight, I should not have been so surprised. Of my friends and acquaintances most are either social scientists or civil/mechanical engineers.

Chances are that if you do not have a background in software engineering then you have heard of, but have not been exposed to GitHub. Indeed, that was my case. While I had seen plenty of people reference or link to GitHub repositories (fancy word for your project), I never had the opportunity to work on a project that used this service. 

In the end, having come across GitHub multiple times online, and having downloaded data from it - I decided it was finally time to try it on one of my projects. It took me less than a day to realize that there was no going back to my old heathanistic lifestyle. I had finally seen the light.  

Today, I would like to convince you, dear reader, of what I have learned: that GitHub is for everyone, regardless of your ~~race, gender, and~~ occupation or interests! If you work with data then GitHub is for you! 

To prove my point, I'd like to share with you what I think are five practical ways that GitHub can help you on your next project. 

## But First... Some Basics

GitHub is a hosting platform that enables users to upload (i.e., "push") their s


Here are four reasons why you should use GitHub. 

## Reason 1: Version Control

I suspect that one of the reasons folks are intimidated to use GitHub is that they hear concepts such as "version control" and "source code" and assume only computer programmers can hope to understand. Fact of the matter is that "source code" can reference just about anything; including, whatever data you are currently working on. For example, a a simple spreadsheet containing anonymized results from a recent poll or lab experiment is source code when uploaded to GitHub. Source code does does not need to be a machine learning algorithm or NASA code for sending a rover to Mars. It'd just whatever data or code you happen to upload. 

*Version control* then is the ability to maintain a record of all the changes that have been made to your *source code*. That's it. Nothing spooky. In fact, services like dropbox keep similar histories of your data. But GitHub puts you in more control as a scientist (or journalist, independent researchers, hobbiest, etc).



## Reason 2: Science and Reproducability 

## Reason 3: Collaboration with Colleagues

## Reason 4: Community Support

## Reason 5: It's Easy!
