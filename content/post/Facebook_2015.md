*This post introduces my GitHub repository [Facebook_2015](https://github.com/Lucas-Czarnecki/Facebook_Canada2015) and the kinds of research questions it can help answer.*

## Introduction 

I recently, in an effort to move my past and current projects onto GitHub, created a new repository called [Facebook_2015](https://github.com/Lucas-Czarnecki/Facebook_Canada2015). This repository contains data I collected for my masters thesis that I believe will be of general interest to social scientists. The scheer size of this repository lends itself to answer many research questions.

Note that this blog only offers a quick summary of the data. For more detailed information please see the repository's README file.

## The 2015 Election Campaign

The repository contains Facebook user data from the 2015 Canadian general election. The campaign was the longest in modern Canadian history at 78 days and resulted in one the highest voter turnout in Canada since the 1990s. The campaign touched on multiple high profile issues including the Syrian migration crisis, the controversial niqab ban, the senate expenses scandal, and heated debates about the Canadian economy. Overall, the issues, salience, and length of the campaign make it one of the most compelling elections to study in recent memory.

## What's Inside

The data consists of federal party leadersâ€™ (i.e., Stephen Harper, Justin Trudeau, and Tom Mulcair) campaign messages (N = 1,711) and the responses to those messages from everyday Facebook users (n = 92,516). Data range from August 4th to October 19, 2015; the duration of the campaign on Facebook. 

 The scripts I use to clean and organize the data are also included. 

The repository contains both raw as well as cleaned datasets. These are separated into their respective folders; [dataset](https://github.com/Lucas-Czarnecki/Facebook_Canada2015/tree/master/data/datasets) and [raw](https://github.com/Lucas-Czarnecki/Facebook_Canada2015/tree/master/data/raw).
