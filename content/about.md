I am a social and data science researcher with a background in political psychology looking to improve how public institutions communicate and disseminate data with the public. I have experience inside and outside of academia. I started programming for a master's thesis that examined campaign effects on Facebook and haven't stopped coding since.

*I built and maintain this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the [anatole theme](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).*
